# Expo Camera: Corrupt Image Data from takePictureAsync()

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo Camera API where accessing pixel data from an image captured using `Camera.takePictureAsync()` can result in corrupt or incomplete data. This issue leads to crashes or incorrect image manipulation during custom image processing.

## Bug Description
When capturing an image and subsequently attempting to access its pixel data for custom processing, the retrieved data may be unexpectedly incomplete or corrupted, resulting in application instability or flawed image manipulation.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Capture an image using the app.
5. Observe the error in the console or unexpected behavior in the image processing.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying data integrity after capturing an image. Check the image data size and format before proceeding with any processing. Implementing error handling, such as try-catch blocks, ensures that the application does not crash due to the corrupt data. If possible, fallback to alternative image processing methods, or re-capture the image in case of errors.

## Additional Notes
This bug might be related to specific device configurations, Expo SDK versions, or underlying platform limitations. It's highly recommended to thoroughly test your image processing pipeline on various devices and platforms.
